## Philosophy
This websites philosophy is to highlight many different strategies for front end solutions in a concise space. Displays like the document reader, shells, and broadcast system are all hand crafted while wrapping minimal functionality external libraries. I hope to add a sample external API app (Google API or something of the sort) with external login to highlight OpenIDConnect usage.

## Technologies
This website is built on React + Redux with various React Libraries. The production build has been bundled with Webpack. This website uses Typescript for concreteness.
